# Dominion #
Another war game with hex tiles.

## Map Editor ##
The map editor will always read from and write to the map.dwm file in the current working directory. The map is saved automatically when the editor is closed. Press left alt to view the map and brush options.

## Server ##
Run the server with the map you wish to use in the current working directory named "map.dwm". When all players are connected, enter the "start" command into the server console to begin play.

## Client ##
Enter a username and ip address of the server you wish to connect to. You will be greeted by a beautiful black screen. Wait for the server to start the game for the map to be loaded.
